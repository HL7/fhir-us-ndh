### Background & scope
An insurancePlan is a discrete package of health insurance coverage benefits. Each insurancePlan has a type which describe the product. An insurancePlan may offer its coverage benefits under a particular network. If an insurancePlan does not have a network, each plan of the insurancePlan must define a distinct plan type (InsurancePlace.plan.type). 

InsurancePlan describes a health insurance offering comprised of a list of covered benefits (i.e. the product), costs associated with those benefits (i.e. the insurance plan), and additional information about the offering, such as who own it, who administer it, coverage area, contact information, etc.
