### Scope and Usage
The HealthcareService resource is commonly used to describe the range of services offered by an organization or practitioner at a specific location. This resource can cover a diverse range of services across the entire healthcare spectrum, including but not limited to promotion, prevention, diagnostics, hospital and ambulatory care, home care, long-term care, and other health-related and community services.

The primary intention for the network extension of the HealthcareService is to cater to services related to social services.

The extension for Healthcare Service or Program Requirement is applied at both the Service and Program levels. Each Service or Program can have multiple requirements, and each requirement can have several constraints. For instance, one service could be specifically for teens, another for females, or even one designed exclusively for teenage girls. Restrictions should be utilized only when there are particular limitations, such as services solely for females or veterans.

If a service supports multiple languages, up to six for example, it's unlikely that these would be restricted within this extension. Instead, the languages spoken should be documented under the "healthcareService.communication" field.
