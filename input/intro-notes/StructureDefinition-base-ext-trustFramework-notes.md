For establishing a peer-to-peer connection, compatibility across various trust frameworks is essential. For instance, when considering the aspect of the CareQuality, it's important to identify the specific endpoint involved. Traditionally, for such interactions, an organization might direct you to use the Health Information Exchange (HIE). However, in the current scenario, it might be more appropriate to utilize the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) framework for these specific needs. This approach is particularly relevant because some required connections may not be within the organization but might exist as non-HIE endpoints. When operating within a trusted framework, it becomes crucial to know which organizations are part of this trust network and the corresponding endpoints for communication. This understanding acknowledges that while frameworks like TEFCA (Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement) are significant, there are other external frameworks and connections to consider. Therefore, we should focus on these three aspects: cross-framework compatibility, identifying endpoints within the trust framework, and acknowledging the existence of external networks beyond TEFCA.
