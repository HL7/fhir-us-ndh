A trust framework is a structured set of rules, policies, protocols, and standards that define how trust is established, managed, and maintained between different entities (such as organizations, systems, or users) involved in the exchange of healthcare information. It provides the guidelines and technical specifications to ensure secure, interoperable, and reliable data exchange. SMART, UDAP, and DirectTrust are examples of trust frameworks.

Sometimes, people refer to CareQuality, CommonWell, or TEFCA as trust frameworks, although they are actually trust communities. These communities agree to follow a trust framework to securely exchange health information. In practice, different communities may use the same trust framework with some additional rules. As a result, implementers may use the terms trust framework and trust community interchangeably.
