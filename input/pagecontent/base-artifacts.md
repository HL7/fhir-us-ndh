### The National Directory of Healthcare Providers & Services (NDH) Profiles
The following presents the list of Directory NDH profiles. Each profile defines the minimum mandatory elements, extensions, and terminology requirements that are required to be present (MUST support). For every profile, there is a simple summary of  requirements and guidance, the usage and scope of the profile, and the boundaries and relationship with other profiles. A structured table presents a [logical view](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/formats.html#table) of the content in both a differential and snapshot view. This is complemented with references to relevant terminologies, search parameters, and examples.

* [Directory Endpoint]
* [Directory HealthcareService]
* [Directory InsurancePlan]
* [Directory Location]
* [Directory Network]
* [Directory Organization]
* [Directory OrganizationAffiliation]
* [Directory Practitioner]
* [Directory PractitionerRole]
* [Directory Verification]

### The NDH Extensions And Their Relationship With The NDH Directory Profiles
To address the particular use case requirements of the NDH, a set extension is defined. The subsequent table demonstrates where these extensions are incorporated within the profiles.

### NDH Search Parameters
To facilitate efficient data retrieval and standardized querying from the NDH, a series of search parameters has been established. The associated set of search parameters for each profile can be found in the subsequent list.

* [Endpoint Search Parameters]
* [HealthcareService Search Parameters]
* [InsurancePlan Search Parameters]
* [Location Search Parameters]
* [Network Search Parameters]
* [Organization Search Parameters]

### NDH Code Systems
Due to the unavailability of certain required concepts in existing code systems, a distinct set of code systems has been defined within the NDH. You can view this list via the link provided below:
* [NDH Code System]


### NDH Value Sets
The use cases within NDH require specific values not found in the existing value sets. As such, the NDH has defined a set of value sets, which are listed via the link provided below:
