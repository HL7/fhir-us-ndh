### NDH Exchange Actor Profiles

NDH supports two sets of exchange profiles. One set of profiles have their conformance based on [Davinc PDEX Plan Net Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net), we call them as NDH Exchange Profiles. Another set of profiles have their conformance based on [Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/VhDir), we call them as NDH Constrained Exchange Profiles.
