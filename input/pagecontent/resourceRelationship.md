### Overview of NDH - Resource Relationships
Note: the following diagrams provide a high-level view of the relationships between resources used in this IG. They do not necessarily reflect all of the relationships/references between resources.

#### All Resource Relationships 1
A high-level view of the relationships between resources. 
In the NDH resource profiles, there is no inherent relationships. Both Organizations and OrganizationAffiliations can declare a network relationship. Consider a scenario where an OrganizationAffiliation, which is part of a Network, is associated with a PractitionerRole through the Organization. This relationship is not automatically inherited by the PractitionerRole. The PractitionerRole must have its own direct link to the Network. Likewise, any network affiliation declared by a PractitionerRole is not automatically inherited by the organization.

#### All Resource Relationships 3  
All resources reference the Restriction resource, which allows the usage of restriction down to the resource element level. The Restriction resource **SHALL** contained in the resource which has the elements need to be restricted.

#### Practitioner Role Relationships  
PractitionerRole describes the relationship between a practitioner and an organization. A practitioner provides services to the organization at a location. Practitioners also participate in healthcare provider insurance networks through their role at an organization.

#### Organization Affiliation Relationships  
Similar to PractitionerRole, OrganizationAffiliation describes relationships between organizations. For example: 
1. The relationship between an organization and an association it is a member of (e.g., hospitals in a hospital association)
2. An organization that provides services to another organization, such as an organization contracted to provide mental health care for another organization as part of a healthcare provider insurance network
3. Distinct organizations forming a partnership to provide services (e.g., a cancer center)

#### Network / Insurance Plan Relationships  
A network is a group of practitioners and organizations that provide healthcare services for individuals enrolled in a health insurance product/plan (typically on behalf of a payer).
