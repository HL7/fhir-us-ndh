### Exchange Capability Statements


### Conformance Requirements
The primary focus of this implementation guide is a RESTful API for obtaining data from a FHIR-enabled Exchange Directory of National Directory of Healthcare Providers & Services (NDH). This API currently only supports a one-directional flow of information from a FHIR-enabled NDH Exchange Directory into distributed/local environments (i.e., HTTP GETs).
