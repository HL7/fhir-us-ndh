### Capability Statements
The purpose of the Verification capability statement is to enable the verification of resource items against primary sources. This includes various aspects for individual providers, such as education and training, licenses and registrations, board and other certifications, facility affiliations, and practice locations. For organizations, it involves facility information (name, address, taxonomy code, etc.), contact information (NPI, address, etc.), and licensure.
