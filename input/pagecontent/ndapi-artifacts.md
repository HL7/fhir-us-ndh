#### National Directory API Profiles
The following presents the list of National Directory API profiles. National Directory API profiles are based on the base NDH profile, with additional constrains (i.e., more elements are require to be present). Each profile defines the minimum mandatory elements, extensions, and terminology requirements that are required to be present (**MUST** support). For every profile, there is a simple summary of  requirements and guidance, the usage and scope of the profile, and the boundaries and relationship with other profiles. A structured table presents a [logical view](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/formats.html#table) of the content in both a differential and snapshot view. This is complemented with references to relevant terminologies, search parameters, and examples.
